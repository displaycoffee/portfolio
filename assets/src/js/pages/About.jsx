				If you are on this particular page, you likely came here to understand a little more about who I am. Okay, well, first things first.
				My name - Adria - is pronounced <em>ay-dree-uh</em>. I promise you there is no "n" in my name, so don't worry about sticking that
				extra letter in there. I am a frontend developer, but before I got to this point, I wanted to be an animator and then writer.
				Eventually along the years, I dropped the animator act and although I did receive a degree in Communication (with a specialization in
				writing), my interests shifted to coding.
			</p>
			<p>
				I dove head-first into coding ages ago because I wanted to make websites for all my roleplaying (RPG) characters and an anime review
				site. The RPG thing stuck and I often use it for inspiration. For example, you can see my personal site -{' '}
				<a href="//khyeras.org" target="_blank">
					Khy'eras
				</a>{' '}
				- for which I created all the lore and coding versus this{' '}
				<a href="//www.angelfire.com/stars2/wishofthestars" target="_blank">
					sad, excuse of a site
				</a>{' '}
				I made back when Angelfire and Geocities were still a thing. I'm not embarrassed to show the differences here, because it illustrates
				how far I've come. Another interesting tidbit is that my high school years were ones without access to a PC, and as such, I did all my
				coding on a WebTV using the TV's connected keyboard and spamming that tab button. I didn't really understand how websites worked back
				then and what HTML pages were, so my start included signing up for about 20+ accounts to create HTML documents for each content page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyway, things change with time. I figured out what that you could just... make a new HTML document on the same hosting account and
				moved onto coding with sophisticated operating systems like Windows and / or Mac. I love frontend coding; to visually see work come to
				life on the web using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks has always been satisfying (though sometimes frustrating) to me. I also
				adore tools like Sass and CSS is my jam, which sounds kind crazy and might upset certain people. I am primarily self-taught and gained
				a lot of my experience through careers, practice, and consistently telling my brain "No, we already tried that and it doesn't work".
			</p>
			<p>
				Beyond magic screen pixels, I am nestled in mountainous Colorado with my husband, our lovely dog, and a cat that talks to ghosts. I
				love gaming - video games, board games, roleplaying - and this hobby has fueled my interests in both writing and coding. I plan to
				write a book someday, but art is mostly a very casual hobby. I do like to bake sweets and if you couldn't tell, I am a fan of coffee
				by itself (black, no sugar) or in its various other transformations.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you've made it through this, congratulations! As a reward here are extra "fun" facts about me. These are a few of my favorite
				things:
